Mapping with WordPress Made Easy! Create interactive Maps with your choice of Basemaps and customisable Overlays like Markers, location aware Photos and Lines with elevation profiles.

== Description ==

Add Overlays (Markers, Lines and Shapes) to create detailed interactive Maps. Simply add them to your content using the Waymark <a href="https://www.joesway.ca/waymark/docs/shortcodes/">Shortcode</a>.

* <a href="https://www.joesway.ca/waymark/demo/">See the Demo &raquo;</a>
* <a href="https://www.joesway.ca/waymark/docs/">Read the Docs &raquo;</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/morehawes/waymark">View on GitHub &raquo;</a>

Using the <a href="https://www.joesway.ca/waymark/docs/editor/">Editor</a>, each Overlay you add to a Map can be given a title, description, image and categorised using <a href="https://www.joesway.ca/waymark/docs/types/">Types</a>. Waymark can also read Markers and Lines from file (GPX/KML/GeoJSON supported), allowing you to easily embed data stored in these formats.

Waymark was designed to be very customisable, allowing you to change icons, colours and styles, as well as the ability to add multiple <a href="https://www.joesway.ca/waymark/docs/basemaps/">Basemaps</a>.

= Gallery =

An image gallery can be displayed at the bottom of the Map for Markers that have images associated with them. Clicking on an image will display the relevant Marker. Photos are added through the WordPress Media Library and if Waymark detects location metadata (EXIF), photos are added to the Map where they were taken. 

You can see an example of the image gallery <a href="https://www.joesway.ca/map/route-map/">here</a>.

= Line Elevations =

Display an interactive elevation graph for Lines that have elevation data. Minimum/Maximum elevation and total length statistics are also displayed. Customise in Waymark > Settings > Misc. > Elevation Options. 

You can see an example of a Line with elevation data <a href="https://www.joesway.ca/map/route-map/">here</a>.

= Meta =

<a href="https://www.joesway.ca/waymark/docs/meta/">Meta</a> allows you to add information about your Map. By default this is a "Description" field which displays under the Map Editor. You can customise the input fields that are displayed alongside the editor in Waymark > Settings > Meta. Any Meta added will be displayed on the <a href="https://www.joesway.ca/map/route-map/">Map Details</a> page, and can also be displayed through the <a href="https://www.joesway.ca/waymark/docs/shortcodes/">Shortcode</a>. Meta can be organised into Groups, with support for Text, Textarea, Rich Text, Select and Multi-Select input types.

= Collections =

<a href="https://www.joesway.ca/waymark/docs/collections/">Collections</a> allow you to organise your Maps, as well as the ability to display multiple Maps at once using the <a href="https://www.joesway.ca/waymark/docs/shortcodes/">Shortcode</a>. Collections can be nested and Maps can be associated with multiple Collections, meaning you can organise your Maps however best suits you.

= Overlay Filter = 

When enabled, users can filter which Markers, Lines and Shapes are currently visible on the Map by clicking on the layer icon. You can also choose to show/hide certain Types when the Map initially loads.

= Export =

Download the Overlays added to a Map in GeoJSON, GPX and KML formats while editing a Map. With the "Public Export" Setting enabled, site visitors can also download the Overlays currently displayed on the Map Details page. This can be used in conjunction with the Overlay Filter to select which Overlays are downloaded.

= Translations =

Waymark is localization ready! <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/waymark/">Translation contributions</a> greatly appreciated.

== Installation ==

[vimeo https://vimeo.com/349575095]

With Waymark enabled, click on the "Maps" link in the sidebar to create and edit Maps. Once you are happy with your Map, copy the Waymark shortcode and add it to your content.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is There a Demo? =

Yes, <a href="https://www.joesway.ca/waymark/demo/">here</a>.

= Can I Get More Help? =

Yes, please view the <a href="https://www.joesway.ca/waymark/docs/">documentation</a>.

= Does Waymark Support Google Maps? =

While Google Basemaps can be added to Waymark, Waymark does not use the Google Maps API (it uses <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>). There are other plugins available that are made specifically for Google Maps.

== Screenshots ==

1. A Map displaying an image gallery and elevation profile.
2. Editing the Map using the Waymark editor.
3. Switch between multiple Basemaps and choose which Overlays to display.
4. Manage your Maps in WordPress admin.
5. Waymark is very customisable.
